Description:
************
I used Node and Express to implement a chatroom. It's details and features are listed below:

- The homepage  allows users to enter a new chatroom, characterized by an ID generated by the server (e.g., ABC123).
- Each generated chatroom is specified by a unique 6-character alphanumeric identifier.
- Each chatroom is stored in a database table with its unique identifier.
- Upon entering a generated chatroom ("/ABC123"), the user is prompted to choose a nickname/username.
- Any previous messages, along with the nickname of the sender, should be displayed to an entering user.
- Each room has a text input and a button to send the message to everybody in that room
- The users's nickname is displayed with each message sent
- List of messages refresh periodically - every 5 seconds
- All node modules and dependencies are listed in the package.json file.
- SQL queries are protected from SQL injections.
- Every DOM element is styled
